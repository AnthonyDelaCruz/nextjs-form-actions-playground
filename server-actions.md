### What are server actions?

Server actions are a way to invoke a server-side function from a client-side form.

### What are it's benefits?

- You can direclty code business logic in the server-side.
- You don't have to create extra API endpoints.
- Since it's a function, you can use it both in server components and client components.
- No need to manage state in the client-side, form actions already sends the form data as an argument
